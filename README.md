# Music Genre Classification Project

## **Project Overview**
This project is a full-stack application designed to classify music genres based on audio features extracted from `.wav` files. The application uses a machine learning model to analyze audio data and determine the most suitable genre for each track. 

The backend is powered by **Django**, while the frontend is built using **React.js**. The system also includes a database to store relevant data and ensure efficient querying.
